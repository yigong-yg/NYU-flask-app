## Protobia

Protobia is the old-schooled BBS platform where you can randomly share your experiences when you explore the city.
The platform is totally anonymous! You can post anything you want, as long as it is not harmful or dangerous (we will delete it :)
When you post a review, include the place (just the name), your review and a number rating, and that's it.
You can freely view other people's reviews on the platform, and maybe you will find a same one.

Features:
1. Read all reviews available, and edit or delete your own reviews;
2. Get a random review! Suitable for random challenge if you don't know where to go;
3. Outsource link to our sponsor Resy.
